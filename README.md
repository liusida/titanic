# titanic

Trying to use Titan to do experiments.

This project gets around `vcpkg` and includes Titan project as part of it, so it is possible to touch the source code of Titan when needed and rebuild all.

The folder `titan` is cloned from `https://github.com/ja3067/Titan`, we can `cd titan; git pull;` to keep it up to date.
